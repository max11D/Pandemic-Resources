        <h2>Free Internet Service Offers</h2>
        <p>
            With the shift to remote work and distance learning due to COVID-19, it's more important than ever
            to have reliable internet access. Many internet service providers (ISPs) have 
            rolled out special offers for students (usually two months of free service for
            new subscribers).
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note that in order to take advantage of any particular offer,
            <i>you must live in an area served by the ISP.</i>
        </p>
